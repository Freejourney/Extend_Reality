# Extend_Reality

In this poject image recognition and map localization are used to record specific places.

It just like giving the particular places other new characteristics and we can use our phone to see the new characteristics.

For example, if you have played some computer games, you'll find that there are some interesting stones, which is written some words by

other players after you click it. 

So we can not only use it in games now. 

We can extend reality to more vast virtual world.(Yeah! its a AR application in some degree!)

Finally the project is under development, so it's still unavailable, please don't download and use it!
